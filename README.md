# Challenge1: Code Refractor

## Description

For this project, I was excited to see how I was able to apply what I learned in class to this challenge and what difficulties would arise along the way.

This challenge allowed me to use my knowledge of html and css to refractor code. Starter codes were provided for us because our we were tasked to modify and improve codes to make it more accessible and cleaner.

Going through the starter code, I was able to pinpoint a couple changes I would immediatley work on.
* HTML semantics because there was too many ```<div>``` tags
* Consolidate CSS properties and selectors because there were lots of similar rules
* Add accessible alt attributes

Applying HTML semantic tags instead of using ```<div>``` tags allows the reader and myself to understand what each section of my code is. For example, instead of using ```<div class="header">```, I can just use the ```<header>``` tag.

Instead of having multiple selectors and repeating the same styles for each one, I was able to consolidate them. This makes my code easier to read while also making it easier to maintain if I need to make any changes. Instead of changing multiple selectors in CSS, I can just edit one selector.

One of the easier edits was adding alt attributes to all the images. This is important in case an image is not abled to be viewed by the user.

I enjoyed the project because I was able to learn many different things and expand my knowledge of HTML and CSS. I was able to play around with grouping selectors and how I wanted my selectors to be grouped. Being able to test it out and see which grouping worked and which didn't allowed me to learn the reasons why and how I could improve the codes.

## Usage

I could not screenshot the whole website how I like it so it had to be chopped in three parts. The site looks exactly the same as the starter code so all that was changed was making the code more accessible and nicer. Also making the navbar links all work to navigate to the correct section.
